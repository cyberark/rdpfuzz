^CMake Warning \(dev\) at .*/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:[0-9]+ \(message\):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: GL

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: OpenGL
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: GLX

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.$
