$$ walk fcache fifo list, with next_fcache at a different offset
$$ for an EmptySlot vs a Fragment.

$$ usage: store fifo value into t0:
$$ r $t0 = 27ece6a8

$$ field offsets valid as of fragment.h:1.163, fcache.c:1.165
$$ note that this only applies to private fragments which now have
$$ a different layout than shared (private_fragment_t), as shared do
$$ not use a fifo list

$$ must use pseudo-register, not something like u1, which doesn't work
$$ due to literal textual expansion rather than value replacement.
$$ @ makes it MUCH faster since won't try to look up as symbol.
