$$ walk vmareas frags list, with next_vmarea at a different offset
$$ for a MultiEntry vs a Fragment.

$$ usage: store frags value into t0:
$$ r $t0 = 27ece6a8

$$ field offsets valid as of fragment.h:1.163, vmareas.c:1.258

$$ must use pseudo-register, not something like u1, which doesn't work
$$ due to literal textual expansion rather than value replacement.
$$ @ makes it MUCH faster since won't try to look up as symbol.
