\page page_drcpusim CPU Simulator

\p drcpusim is a DynamoRIO client tool for testing that applications will
run correctly on legacy processors.

 - \ref sec_drcpusim
 - \ref sec_drcpusim_run
 - \ref sec_drcpusim_ops

\section sec_drcpusim Overview

The DynamoRIO tool \p drcpusim emulates execution on a specified CPU model
in order to validate that a target application does not execute any
instructions that are illegal or not implemented on a legacy processor.


\section sec_drcpusim_run Running the Simulator

To launch \p drcpusim, use the \p -t flag to \p drrun and specify a CPU
model via the \p -cpu parameter:

\code
bin64/drrun -t drcpusim -cpu PentiumPro -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

The target application will be launched under a DynamoRIO client that
monitors every instruction executed.  If an instruction is attempted to be
executed that is not supported on the requested CPU model, \p drcpusim will
abort the execution and report the offending instruction.  Any child
processes will be followed into and checked as well.


\section sec_drcpusim_ops Simulator Parameters

\p drcpusim's behavior can be controlled through options passed after the
\p -c \p drcpusim but prior to the "--" delimiter on the command line:

\code
bin64/drrun -t drcpusim <options> <to> <drcpusim> -- /path/to/target/app <args> <for> <app>
\endcode

Boolean options can be disabled using a "-no_" prefix.

The parameters available are described below:
