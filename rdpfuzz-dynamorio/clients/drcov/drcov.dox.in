\page page_drcov Code Coverage Tool

\p drcov is a DynamoRIO client tool that collects code coverage information.
 - \ref sec_drcov
 - \ref sec_drcov2lcov

\section sec_drcov The Code Coverage Client

The DynamoRIO tool \p drcov collects information about which basic blocks
have been executed.  It writes the results to a separate log file per process.

The runtime options for this tool include:
 - \b -dump_text:
    Dumps the log file in text format.
 - \b -dump_binary:
    On by default, dumps the log file in binary format.
 - \b -\[no_\]nudge_kills:
    Windows only. On by default.
    Uses nudge to notify the process for termination
    so that the exit event will be called.
 - \b -logdir dir:
    Sets log directory, which by default is ".".

\section sec_drcov2lcov Post-Processing

A post-processing tool \p drcov2lcov is provided to convert binary log files
generated by the drcov client to the lcov format.
The resulting files can be processed by
<a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php">lcov</a>.  We
provide a modified version of lcov's \p genhtml script which includes
support for running on Windows.  Our copy of \p genhtml is available in the
same directory as the \p drcov2lcov executable.

To exclude the source files for system libraries, we recommend using the \p
-src_filter option to specify the root directory of the target
application's source files.

Here is an example of post-processing a single log file:

\code
tools/bin64/drcov2lcov -input drcov.myapp.30239.0000.proc.log -src_filter mydir
\endcode

This results in a file \p coverage.info in the lcov format.  This can be
processed using the \p genhtml script:

\code
perl tools/bin64/genhtml coverage.info
\endcode

The final result is a set of web pages that allow viewing per-line coverage
of each source file in a visual manner.

If \p genhtml complains about missing source files from third-party
libraries used by the application, the option \p --ignore-errors=source can
be passed to the script.

When post-processing a log file created on another machine, use the \p
-pathmap option:

\code
tools/bin32/drcov2lcov -input drcov.myapp.30239.0000.proc.log -pathmap /data/local/tmp/ /home/derek/android/
\endcode

The command line options for \p drcov2lcov are as follows:
